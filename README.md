# Ford-Fulkerson-Algorithm
Question Statement: Implement the network flow based scheduling algorithm without considering resource sharing and precedence. You should test your algorithm with a set of tasks.

#How To Execute
**Running the above Java program with a sample input:**
> - The first line inputs the number of nodes.
> - According to the input above, next ‘n’ lines denote the graph matrix.
> - Next we enter the source.
> - Then we enter the sink.
> - The max flow output follows.

**Following is a sample output**
```
Enter the number of nodes
6
Enter the graph matrix
0 16 13 0 0 0
0 0 10 12 0 0
0 4 0 0 14 0
0 0 9 0 0 20
0 0 0 7 0 4
0 0 0 0 0 0
Enter the source of the graph
1
Enter the sink of the graph
6
The Max Flow is 23
Process finished with exit code 0
```
